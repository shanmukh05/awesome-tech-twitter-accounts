# Code of Conduct

This project is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

Expected behavior

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Assume good faith and give people the benefit of the doubt.
- Keep discussions focused on content, not individuals.

Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory language.
- Abusive, defamatory, or insulting remarks directed at contributors or maintainers.
- Posting private information or doxxing.
- Trolling, sustained disruption of discussions, or spamming.

Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it by opening an issue and mentioning `@maintainers` (or choose a private channel if preferred). Include:

- A short description of the incident.
- Links to the relevant comments/PRs/issues.
- Any supporting context.

Maintainers will review reports and respond as quickly as possible. Consequences may include a request to stop the behavior, temporary or permanent banning from the repository, or referral to GitHub in serious cases.

Contact

If you need to file a confidential report, provide a contact email in an issue for maintainers to follow up privately. (Replace this with a project-specific contact email if you have one.)

Thank you for helping maintain a positive community.
